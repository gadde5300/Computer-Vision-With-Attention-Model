# Computer-Vision-With-Attention-Model

## Introduction

Modern day techniques employed in Neural Networks in the domain of Computer Vision include "Attention Mechanisms". Computer Vision has aimed to emulate human visual perception in terms of code-based algorithms. Before diving further into the Attention Mechanisms used in Computer Vision, let's take a brief look at how attention mechanisms are embedded in and inspired by human visual capabilities.

Light traverses from the object of interest (which in this case is a leaf) to the Macula, which is the primary functional
region of the Retina inside the eye. However, what happens when we have multiple objects in the field of view? When
we must focus on a single object when there is an array of diverse objects in our field of view, the attention mechanism
within our visual perception system uses a sophisticated group of filters to create a blurring effect (similar to that of
"Bokeh" in digital photography) so the object of interest is in focus, while the surrounding is faded or blurred


### Now, back to Attention Mechanisms in Deep Learning.

The attention mechanism has become a very popular technique in natural language processing, image processing, and computer vision. The attention mechanism can generate attention-aware features and features that can be extracted based on spatial, context, or channel aware-features.

Using visual attention in an image classification task helps determine important image regions and
their correlations. The presence or absence of image regions is critical to classification.

As we can see here in this image how the attention module focuses ona particularfeature from layer to layer during the training of the model.
